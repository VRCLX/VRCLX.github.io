# Step 1 - What is DMX?
DMX, short for Digital Multiplex, is a communication protocol used in the entertainment industry to control lighting and effects. It allows for the transmission of data from a controller to various lighting fixtures and devices, enabling synchronized control over multiple elements in a lighting setup.

For VRChat, DMX is used to create dynamic and interactive lighting experiences within virtual environments. By utilizing DMX, creators can design intricate lighting setups that respond to user interactions, music, or other in-world events.
